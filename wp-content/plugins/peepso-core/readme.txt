PeepSo is the next-generation of Social Networking plugin for WordPress. It allows you to create an online community in seconds.

== Description ==

[PeepSo](http://peepso.com/ "PeepSo - Social Network Plugin for WordPress") is a super-light, free, **social network** plugin for WordPress that allows you to quickly and effortlessly add a social network or an online community, similar to **Facebook** right inside your WordPress site. **Social network for WordPress** - in just a few clicks!
 
The plugin supports the addition of a **social networking** plugin in the main area of your WordPress site. Widgets that display users' photos, videos and friends are also available on installation and can be placed on any widget position inside your theme, or directly inside PeepSo itself.

Our primary goal when developing this social networking plugin for WordPress was to provide those who wanted to create a **community** with WordPress an alternative to the existing solutions, with a modern look and feel, lots of great features and scalability.

What sets PeepSo apart from other **social networking** solutions is its light weight and stellar design. PeepSo works right out of the box and within seconds, you can start a **social network**, right inside your WordPress site. There's no need to hire a developer, mess with code, hack another plugin to make it look and work the way you want it. It simply works.

The [PeepSo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-core/ "PeepSo - Social Network Plugin for WordPress") core is totally **free**. We encourage you to install it and see how it works. Keep in mind, some features are not available on the free version. There are currently three free additional plugins for PeepSo:

* [PeepSo Moods](https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-moods/) MoodSo is a plugin for [PeepSo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-core/ "PeepSo - Social Network Plugin for WordPress"). It lets members share one of sixteen different moods on their stream using emoticons. 
* [PeepSo Tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-tags/) - TagSo is a plugin for [PeepSo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-core/ "PeepSo - Social Network Plugin for WordPress") which enables tagging of friends or any other member who contributed to a stream post. Simply type @ then the name of the member you’d like to tag. Tagged members can get onsite and email notifications. 
* [PeepSo Location](https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-location/) - LocSo is a plugin for [PeepSo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-core/ "PeepSo - Social Network Plugin for WordPress"). It lets your users share their location in their status updates. They will also be able to send their location in private messages.

There are also other plugins available for a pretty low price. Installing all of them will give you all the features that PeepSo has to offer. The plugins enable sharing photos on the stream, sharing videos, images, friends, messages and chat. View the [features and Pricing](http://peepso.com/pricing "PeepSo Pricing")

On the profile page, users can share their profiles on social media sites such as: Facebook, del.icio.us, Digg, StumbleUpon, Blinklist, Google+, Diigo, Myspace, Twitter, Blogmarks, Lifestream, LinkedIn, Newsvine and Google Bookmarks.
 
== Try the demo ==
